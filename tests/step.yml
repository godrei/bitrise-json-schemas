title: iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect API
summary: Automatically manages your iOS Provisioning Profiles for your Xcode project.
description: |-
  The Step uses the official [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/generating_tokens_for_api_requests). The Step can obtain the API connection information in 2 ways:
  It can use either the Bitrise Apple Developer connection selected under the **Team** tab for the application, or you can provide the information to the Step using Step's input variables.
  The Steps performs the following:
  - It generates, updates and downloads the provisioning profiles needed for your iOS project.
  - It verifies if your project is registered with the App Store Connect. If it was not, the Step registers your project.
  - It registers the iOS devices connected to your Bitrise account with the App Store Connect.
  - It modifies the iOS project to use manual code signing if the project uses automatically managed signing.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Before you start configuring the Step, make sure you've completed the following requirements:
  1. You've generated an [API key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api) and obtained an **Issuer ID**, **Key ID** and a **Private Key**.
  2. You've [defined your Apple Developer Account to Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#defining-your-apple-developer-account-to-bitrise).
  3. You've [assigned an Apple Developer Account to your app](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#assigning-an-apple-developer-account-for-your-app).

  Once these are done, most of the required Step input fields are already populated for you.

  To configure the Step:

  1. Add the **iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect API** after any dependency installer Step in your Workflow, such as **Run CocoaPods install** or **Carthage**.
  2. Click the Step to edit its input fields. You can see that the **Build API token**, **Build URL**, and the **Xcode Project (or Workspace) path** inputs are automatically filled out for you.
      - **Build API token**: Every running build has a temporary API token on a Bitrise virtual machine. This token is only available while the build is running. The Step downloads the connected API key with the help of this API token and Bitrise saves it in a JSON file.
      - **Build URL**: URL of the current build or local path URL to your `apple_developer_portal_data.json`.
      - **Xcode Project path**: The path where the `.xcodeproj` / `.xcworkspace` is located.
  3. **Distribution type** input's value has to match with the value of the **Select method for export** input in the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** Step.
  4. With the **Scheme name** input you can restrict which targets to process.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you do not have the **Certificate and Profile Installer** Step in your Workflow.
  Make sure that you do NOT modify your Xcode project between the **iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect API** and the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** Steps. For example, do not change the **bundle ID** after the **iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect API** Step.

      This input variable allows you to specify how the Step determines the API connection to use.
      - `automatic`: The Step can use either method: It will attempt to use the Bitrise Apple Developer connection first. If this is not available, it will use the Step input variables.
      - `api_key`: The Step will only use the Bitrise Apple Developer connection. It will not use the Step input variables.
      - `off`: The Step will only use the Step input variables. It will not use the Bitrise Apple Developer connection.

      **NOTE:** The Step will only recognize the API key if the filename includes the  `KEY_ID` value as shown on the examples above.

      You can upload your key on the **Generic File Storage** tab in the Workflow Editor and set the Environment Variable for the file here.
